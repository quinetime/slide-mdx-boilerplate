# ARGUMENTS

### What is an argument?

---

<FancyList>

<li>It's not a squabble. The goal is proof, not persuasion.</li>

<li>Don't think of arguments between two people.  Think of arguments as being internal: a way for you to decide what to believe.</li>

</FancyList>

---

<DefBox nameplate="Argument">

An attempt to rationally justify some assertion.

</DefBox>

---

## This assertion is the *conclusion* of the argument.

	ARGUMENT 1: The quality of a government in a country correlates positively with voter turnout: the greater the voter turnout, the better the government.  Therefore, low voter turnout causes bad government.  So if you're eligible and fail to vote, you make the government worse.  What's more, democracy can only persist if enough people turn out to vote; therefore, if you're eligible to vote and you don't do so, you imperil democracy itself.  It follows that if you're eligible to vote, it's morally wrong for you not to do so.

	ARGUMENT 2: Let us take for granted that God exists.  Then he is all-knowing, and he existed before you were born.  Being all-knowing, before you were born God knew <em>everything</em> that would happen in your life.  He could foresee your every action and every decision.  It follows that your whole life was predetermined, and none of your choices have been genuinely free. Thus, you don't have free will.

	ARGUMENT 3: A given quantity of money is worth more to a poor person than to a rich person.  (For example, for a rich person, $1000 is a weekend in New York; for a poor person, $1000 is the difference between going hungry and having enough to eat.)  This means that if a quantity of money is taken from a rich person and transferred to a poor person, the loss of welfare to the rich person is smaller than the gain in welfare to the poor person.  This means that a redistributive system of tax and benefits increases the average welfare level in society.  The government's goal should be to increase the average welfare level in society.  And so the government should maintain a redistributive system of tax and benefits.

	ARGUMENT 4: Sometimes people claim that they have been abducted by aliens or have seen a UFO. But when we look closely at these cases, we usually find that the person making the claim is highly untrustworthy, or there is some other sort of explanation for why they have such a strange belief. If aliens really did exist, we would expect to end up with a lot of sightings that can't be dismissed. (Sure, sure, maybe we can't explain every sighting, but the ones that can't be immediately dismissed are so rare and so unusual that we have every reason to think that there's some sort of earthly explanation, so we can dismiss them too.) Therefore, there isn't extraterrestial life in the galaxy.

	ARGUMENT 5: Voting in most political elections is useless. The purpose of voting is to influence the outcome of an election. But I can be practically certain that my vote will not influence anything at all! Very few elections come down to a single vote, so I am fully justified in believing that my vote will have no impact upon who wins. Yes, of course: if everyone thought like this, then that would be bad. But I am not everyone! I don't control anyone else's vote. My decision can impact only my own vote. And because I know that my own vote won't make a difference, there's really no point in bothering to head to the polls.

1. Tom was definitely at the party.  He must have been drinking, because everybody at the party was drinking.
2. A long holiday would be good for the both of us, so we should go for it!
3. Ray would only come to the party if Chin or Shandra were here.  Chin's not here.  Shandra's not here.  I guess Ray's not here either!
4. It probably won't rain tomorrow.  The forecast predicted sun.
5. It probably won't rain tomorrow.  We should go on a hike in the Adirondacks.

	If it was the taxi driver who murdered the drummer, there would have been blood on the back seat of the taxi.  But there was no blood in the taxi.  It was either the taxi driver or the roadie who murdered the drummer.  Since it can't have been the taxi driver, it must have been the roadie.

# Evaluating Arguments

---

### The truth of the conclusion is not what you should be looking at.

### What you should ask are the following two questions:

---

<FancyList>

<li>Are the premises true?</li>

<li>Does the conclusion follow from the premises?</li>

</FancyList>

---

# Types of Reasoning

---

<FancyList>

<li> Deduction </li>
<li> Induction </li>
<li> Abduction </li>

</FancyList>

---

<DefBox nameplate="Deductive Argument">

If the premises are true, the conclusion <em>must</em> be true.

</DefBox>

---

<DefBox nameplate="Inductive Argument">

If the premises are true, the conclusion is <em>probably</em> true (because it continues a pattern that has been observed).

</DefBox>

---

<DefBox nameplate="Abductive Argument">

If the premises are true, the conclusion is <em>probably</em> true (because it's the best explanation for the premises).

</DefBox>
